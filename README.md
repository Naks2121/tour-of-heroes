# Tour Of Heroes

## About

The Tour of Heroes app helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The app has many of the features you'd expect to find in any data-driven application. The finished app acquires and displays a list of heroes, edits a selected hero's detail, and navigates among different views of heroic data.

* Used built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.

* Used one-way data binding for read-only data.
* Added editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
* Created bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
* Enabled users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view.
* Formatted data with pipes.
* Created a shared service to assemble the heroes.
* Used routing to navigate among different views and their components.
